# Steam Currency Converter

Takes scraped raw value as input, extracts its price and currency 
and converts price to target currency.

The up-to-date available currencies to customers on Steam are can be found in this 
[documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing/currencies).
 

## Usage
1. This API uses [fixer.io](https://fixer.io/) currency API inside it. You should take
an API key from [fixer.io](https://fixer.io/) and put it in environment variable.

    ```FIXERIO_API_KEY="api_key"```
 
   (Note: In the code, the API endpoint is created as below:

   ```url = "http://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key=" + api_key``` )
2. Before converting your raw values, you should create a json file 
with the code below. Currency values are changing frequently during 
the daytime, so you can update values by rerunning the function.
     
    ```SteamCurrencyExchanger.updateCurrencyJSONFile()``` 

3. Now you can give your scraped raw price strings as below and get
price in targeted currency.

    ```python
   >>> exchanger = SteamCurrencyExchanger()
  
   >>> myPrice1: str = exchanger.convertPrice('R$ 13,05')
   >>> myPrice1
   '17.03 TRY'
   
   >>> myPrice2: str = exchanger.convertPrice('â‚ª57.00')
   >>> myPrice2
   '122.92 TRY'
   
   >>> myPrice3: str = exchanger.convertPrice('$1,095.85 USD')
   >>> myPrice3
   '8035.91 TRY'
   ```
